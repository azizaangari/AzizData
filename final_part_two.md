# Wireframes

Below are my wireframes and initial storyboard for what I used to conduct my user feedback. As you can see, the sketches represent the outline developed in Part 1 of the Final Project. I intentionally chose not to make them "perfect" in order to squeeze in as much information and feedback as possible from the people I interviewed:

# User Research

My topic is about H-1B Visas, a complex type of work visa that many immigrants (mostly students), strive for to work in the United States. I interviewed 7 different, random people to provide insights onto the sketches provided above. Below are further details of my research which include the demographics of my interviewees as well as the target audience I intended for.

## Target Audience

College or Graduate students in the United States who already have some knowledge (even if only minimal) of US work visas. My initial target audience were non-U.S. citizens studying in the United States, and while that demographic has been represented in my pool of interviewees, I decided to also include U.S. citizens in an attempt to further refine my research.

## Approach to identifying

I would first begin with asking a few background information. I start by asking if they have any knowledge of H-1B Visas and, if so, how would they rate their knowledge from 1-5 (with 5 being the highest). I would then proceed with background information such as academic major, national origin, citizenship status, age, and the gender they identify with.

## Interviews and Scripts

I managed to find 7 individuals to participate in the study. All but one are undergraduate students at Carnegie Mellon. Below is the scenario I used for all7 individuals, including all questions asked and their answers to those questions.

### Script

As stated earlier, I begin by asking a few background information. As shown below:

1. **_Do you have any knowledge whatsoever on H-1B Visas? (if yes, then I proceed.)_**

2. **_What is the race you identify with?_**

3. **_What is the gender you identify with?_**

4. **_What is yout nationality/Immigration status?_**

5. **_What is your academic major?_**

6. **_On a scale of 1-5, how would you rate your knowledge of H-1B Visas with 5 being the highest?_**


After asking about their background, I show them the initial wireframe / storyboard and ask them to take a look at it for as much time as they need (most took less than 3 minutes), and I would then ask them the below questions regarding the wireframes:

1. **_On a scale of 1-5, how easily can you understand the information provided in the wireframes/storyboards?_**
2. **_Based on your understanding of immigration law and H-1B visas, is there anything surprising from these visuals/sketches?_**
3. **_What would you add to make things better to understand?_**
4. **_What would you remove to make things better to understand?_**
5. **_What information do you think would be beneficial for companies & beneficiaries filing for H-1B Visas to know and be included in this study?_**
