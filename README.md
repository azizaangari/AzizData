Here is my public portfolio, excited to share this with the Telling Stories with Data class.

# About Me
My name is Aziz and I'm an international student from Saudi Arabia studying Entertainment. I decided to join the MEIM program at CMU shortly after the rise of the entertainment industry in Saudi Arabia. I plan on utilizing the skills gained in the MEIM program to develop a more structural sense of the entertainment industry. This can includes efficiently monetizing concerts and events, managing policies regarding entertainment, as well as uplift a long-hidden stream of talent among Saudis.

# What I hope to learn
This class reminded me of a YouTube channel called Vox. A large majority of Vox's content includes visually appealing graphs and mindmaps that engage the reader (or watcher). I am interested in the idea of utilizing visuals to simplify complicated data that would have not been accessible to the average person otherwise. Learning how to read, critique, and build visually appealing datasets is what I hope to learn from this course.
