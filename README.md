Here is my public portfolio, excited to share this with the Telling Stories with Data class.

# About Me
My name is Aziz and I'm an international student from Saudi Arabia studying Entertainment. I decided to join the MEIM program at CMU shortly after the rise of the entertainment industry in Saudi Arabia. I plan on utilizing the skills gained in the MEIM program to develop a more structural sense of the entertainment industry. This can includes efficiently monetizing concerts and events, managing policies regarding entertainment, as well as uplift a long-hidden stream of talent among Saudis.

# What I hope to learn
This class reminded me of a YouTube channel called Vox. A large majority of Vox's content includes visually appealing graphs and mindmaps that engage the reader (or watcher). I am interested in the idea of utilizing visuals to simplify complicated data that would have not been accessible to the average person otherwise. Learning how to read, critique, and build visually appealing datasets is what I hope to learn from this course.

# Assignment 4: Data Visualisation & Redesign

## Graph by PwC
For this Data Visualization assignment, I critiqued and redesigned a graph published by PwC in 2017 regarding the projected number of female drivers in Saudi Arabia ([Click here to view their chart on the second page](https://argaamplus.s3.amazonaws.com/664c5b42-f612-4227-91b7-398bfe847e4a.pdf).

## A Clean, Redesigned PwC Graph
Below is my redesign of the graph by PwC. As you can see, I omitted much of the unnecessary information such as projected male drivers (because who cares about that?). I also removed the data of overall population and, instead, compared projected female drivers with the female population in 2020. I felt like this gives more context and provides a fair representation of the projected growth of Saudi female drivers against their female counterparts. Here is my redesign, made with Infogram:

<div class="infogram-embed" data-id="4843b8bc-e4db-43a6-a888-d2e3cddeaba6" data-type="interactive" data-title="Blank template"></div><script>!function(e,i,n,s){var t="InfogramEmbeds",d=e.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];if(window[t]&&window[t].initialized)window[t].process&&window[t].process();else if(!e.getElementById(n)){var o=e.createElement("script");o.async=1,o.id=n,o.src="https://e.infogram.com/js/dist/embed-loader-min.js",d.parentNode.insertBefore(o,d)}}(document,0,"infogram-async");</script><div style="padding:8px 0;font-family:Arial!important;font-size:13px!important;line-height:15px!important;text-align:center;border-top:1px solid #dadada;margin:0 30px"><a href="https://infogram.com/4843b8bc-e4db-43a6-a888-d2e3cddeaba6" style="color:#989898!important;text-decoration:none!important;" target="_blank">Blank template</a><br><a href="https://infogram.com" style="color:#989898!important;text-decoration:none!important;" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Infogram</a></div>
