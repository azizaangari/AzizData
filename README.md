# Aziz Alangari's Portfolio
Welcome to my online portfolio, excited to share this with the **<a href="https://api.heinz.cmu.edu/courses_api/course_detail/94-870" target="_blank">Telling Stories with Data</a>** course at Carnegie Mellon University.

## About Me
My name is Aziz and I'm a Master's student from Saudi Arabia studying Entertainment. I decided to join the **<a href="https://www.heinz.cmu.edu/programs/entertainment-industry-management-master/" target="_blank">MEIM program</a>** at CMU due to my interest in story writing and development in general. I plan on utilizing the skills gained in the MEIM program to develop a more structural sense of the entertainment industry. 

## What I hoped to learn from this class
This class reminded me of **<a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCLXo7UDZvByw2ixzpQCufnA" target="_blank">Vox</a>**'s YouTube channel. A large majority of Vox's content includes visually appealing graphs and mindmaps that engage the reader (or watcher). I am interested in the idea of utilizing visuals to simplify complicated data that would have not been accessible to the average person otherwise. Learning how to read, critique, and build visually appealing datasets is what I hope to learn from this course.

## What I have learned from this class
I enjoyed the utilization of visualization tools like Tableau. Part of my career outcomes at CMU includes storytelling abilities and, much like Vox, creative content is ameliorated with the use of solid visualizations. 

# Final Project - H-1B Visas
**<a href="https://carnegiemellon.shorthandstories.com/azizangari/index.html" target="_blank">Click here</a>** to view my final deliverable on Shorthand, in which I talk about H-1B visas in the United States. 

Below is the breakdown of my project from A-Z. It includes my process from wireframing & brainstorming to gathering feedback and creating my final deliverable.

# Behind the Scenes 
Below is the process I used to create my final deliverable. Each subset in this section includes the process and development of my project since the beginning of the course, and supporting materials that further provide insights on data visualizations and critiques.

My outline, wireframes, storyboards and user research can be found **<a href="https://azizaangari.github.io/AzizData/azizpart2" target="_blank">here</a>**

I go more in-depth after my user research and start funneling my visualizations and ideas **<a href="https://azizaangari.github.io/AzizData/part_three" target="_blank">here</a>**
