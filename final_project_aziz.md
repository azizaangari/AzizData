# Outline

## High-level Outline

H-1B visas are known to be issued to international, high-skilled workers in the United States. After President Trump took office in 2016, the shuffle of immigration law is said to impact H-1B visa holders and applicants. My study will provide an overview of H-1B visa issuance post- and pre-Trump, how the numbers have fluxuated in the last 10 years (if at all), and highlight citizens of countries that have either maintained the level of H-1B visas issued to them and define what those numbers mean from a macroeconomic and socioeconomic level. Furthermore, if legitimate data is available, I will cross-examine H-1B holders who have transitioned from student F-1 Visas against those that have not been student in the U.S. prior to working in it, and see whether having a student visa can be advantagous in getting an H-1B against those those who do not. 

## Project Structure and Major Elements

Below is the structure of my story, and the major elements I want to include to reach a decision on my hypothesis. 

### 1. Industries

Here, I will provide census data that shows which industries sponsor H-1B visas the most. My hypothesis is technology and oil & gas would be at the top of the list, but does that say a lot about the industries themselves or the international workers that applied for them? For example, does the entertainment industry petition of significantly less worker visas than the tech industry because of lack of job skill, or a lack of applicants?

### 2. Nationalities

Providing a list of nationalities and the number of H-1B visas issued to them. Between 2007 and 2017, we have India, China, and the Phillipines at the top of the list. In 2018 alone, India & China accounted for 85.1% of all H-1B visas issued.

### 3. Approvals & Denials

It is clear from census data that denials are increasing, but the data also shows that petitioners are increasing as well. How do these denials affect the industries?

### 4. Gender

More men apply to H-1B visas than women (in most countries, at least). Is there a discrepency between male & female acceptance rates for H-1B visas?


### 5. The Economy

How is the job market and/or health of the economy in those countries? It is important to list the top recipients of working visas and cross-examine their own country's economy against the United States. 


### 6. Sanctuary Cities & H-1B workers

80% of the top cities for H-1B holders to live in are Sanctuary Cities. 

### 7. Salaries & Education

With the new lottery system implemented for H-1B applicants, a majority of them are reserved of Bachelor's Degree holders and the remainder are for Graduate Degree holders. How does that affect the salaries given and why does the U.S. want to do this?
