# Outline

## High-level Outline

H-1B visas are known to be issued to international, high-skilled workers in the United States. After President Trump took office in 2016, the shuffle of immigration law is said to impact H-1B visa holders and applicants. My study will provide an overview of H-1B visa issuance post- and pre-Trump, how the numbers have fluxuated in the last 10 years (if at all), and highlight citizens of countries that have either maintained the level of H-1B visas issued to them and define what those numbers mean from a macroeconomic and socioeconomic level. Furthermore, if legitimate data is available, I will cross-examine H-1B holders who have transitioned from student F-1 Visas against those that have not been student in the U.S. prior to working in it, and see whether having a student visa can be advantagous in getting an H-1B against those those who do not. 

## Project Structure and Major Elements

Below is the structure of my story, and the major elements I want to include to reach a decision on my hypothesis. 

### 1. Industries

Here, I will provide census data that shows which industries sponsor H-1B visas the most. My hypothesis is technology and oil & gas would be at the top of the list, but does that say a lot about the industries themselves or the international workers that applied for them? For example, does the entertainment industry petition of significantly less worker visas than the tech industry because of lack of job skill, or a lack of applicants?

### 2. Nationalities

Providing a list of nationalities and the number of H-1B visas issued to them. Between 2007 and 2017, we have India, China, and the Phillipines at the top of the list. In 2018 alone, India & China accounted for 85.1% of all H-1B visas issued.

### 3. Approvals & Denials

It is clear from census data that denials are increasing, but the data also shows that petitioners are increasing as well. How do these denials affect the industries?

### 4. Gender

More men apply to H-1B visas than women (in most countries, at least). Is there a discrepency between male & female acceptance rates for H-1B visas?


### 5. The Economy

How is the job market and/or health of the economy in those countries? It is important to list the top recipients of working visas and cross-examine their own country's economy against the United States. 


### 6. Sanctuary Cities & H-1B workers

80% of the top cities for H-1B holders to live in are Sanctuary Cities. 

### 7. Salaries & Education

With the new lottery system implemented for H-1B applicants, a majority of them are reserved of Bachelor's Degree holders and the remainder are for Graduate Degree holders. How does that affect the salaries given and why does the U.S. want to do this?


# Sketches

### Here's an initial sketch of H-1B data from 2010:

<div class='tableauPlaceholder' id='viz1581294716410' style='position: relative'><noscript><a href='#'><img alt=' ' src='https:&#47;&#47;public.tableau.com&#47;static&#47;images&#47;20&#47;2010H1-B&#47;Sheet1&#47;1_rss.png' style='border: none' /></a></noscript><object class='tableauViz' style='display:none;'><paramname='host_url'value='https%3A%2F%2Fpublic.tableau.com%2F' /> <param name='embed_code_version' value='3' /> <param name='site_root' value='' /><param name='name' value='2010H1-B&#47;Sheet1' /><param name='tabs' value='no' /><paramname='toolbar' value='yes' /><paramname='static_image'value='https:&#47;&#47;public.tableau.com&#47;static&#47;images&#47;20&#47;2010H1-B&#47;Sheet1&#47;1.png' /> <param name='animate_transition' value='yes' /><param name='display_static_image' value='yes' /><paramname='display_spinner' value='yes' /><param name='display_overlay' value='yes' /><param name='display_count' value='yes' /><param name='filter' value='publish=yes' /></object></div><script type='text/javascript'>var divElement = document.getElementById('viz1581294716410');var vizElement = divElement.getElementsByTagName('object')[0];vizElement.style.width='100%';vizElement.style.height=(divElement.offsetWidth*0.75)+'px';var scriptElement = document.createElement('script');scriptElement.src = 'https://public.tableau.com/javascripts/api/viz_v1.js';                    vizElement.parentNode.insertBefore(scriptElement, vizElement);</script>

### And here's the same data 10 years later:

<div class='tableauPlaceholder' id='viz1581294997313' style='position: relative'><noscript><a href='#'><img alt=' ' src='https:&#47;&#47;public.tableau.com&#47;static&#47;images&#47;H-&#47;H-1B2019&#47;Sheet1&#47;1_rss.png' style='border: none' /></a></noscript><object class='tableauViz'  style='display:none;'><para mname='host_url'value='https%3A%2F%2Fpublic.tableau.com%2F' /> <param name='embed_code_version' value='3' /> <param name='site_root' value='' /><param name='name' value='H-1B2019&#47;Sheet1' /><param name='tabs' value='no' /><param name='toolbar' value='yes' /><param name='static_image'value='https:&#47;&#47;public.tableau.com&#47;static&#47;images&#47;H-&#47;H-1B2019&#47;Sheet1&#47;1.png' /> <param name='animate_transition' value='yes' /><param name='display_static_image' value='yes' /><param name='display_spinner' value='yes' /><param name='display_overlay' value='yes' /><param name='display_count' value='yes' /></object></div><script type='text/javascript'>var divElement = document.getElementById('viz1581294997313');var vizElement = divElement.getElementsByTagName('object')[0];vizElement.style.width='100%';vizElement.style.height=(divElement.offsetWidth*0.75)+'px';var scriptElement = document.createElement('script');scriptElement.src = 'https://public.tableau.com/javascripts/api/viz_v1.js';vizElement.parentNode.insertBefore(scriptElement, vizElement);</script>

### I've also sketched an initial visualization in terms of gender vs. nationality (Keeping in mind that India has the most H-1B visas but very low female representation):

<div class='tableauPlaceholder' id='viz1581298768661' style='position: relative'><noscript><a href='#'><img alt=' ' src='https:&#47;&#47;public.tableau.com&#47;static&#47;images&#47;H-&#47;H-1BGender&#47;Sheet1&#47;1_rss.png' style='border: none' /></a></noscript><object class='tableauViz'  style='display:none;'><param name='host_url' value='https%3A%2F%2Fpublic.tableau.com%2F' /> <param name='embed_code_version' value='3' /> <param name='path' value='views&#47;H-1BGender&#47;Sheet1?:embed=y&amp;:display_count=y&amp;publish=yes' /> <param name='toolbar' value='yes' /><param name='static_image' value='https:&#47;&#47;public.tableau.com&#47;static&#47;images&#47;H-&#47;H-1BGender&#47;Sheet1&#47;1.png' /> <param name='animate_transition' value='yes' /><param name='display_static_image' value='yes' /><param name='display_spinner' value='yes' /><param name='display_overlay' value='yes' /><param name='display_count' value='yes' /><param name='filter' value='publish=yes' /></object></div><script type='text/javascript'>var divElement = document.getElementById('viz1581298768661');var vizElement = divElement.getElementsByTagName('object')[0];vizElement.style.width='100%';vizElement.style.height=(divElement.offsetWidth*0.75)+'px';var scriptElement = document.createElement('script');scriptElement.src = 'https://public.tableau.com/javascripts/api/viz_v1.js';vizElement.parentNode.insertBefore(scriptElement, vizElement);</script>


### Finally, using census data I managed to create an initial graph of the decline in H-1B approvals just as soon as the Trump Administration held office:

<div class='tableauPlaceholder' id='viz1581300709807' style='position: relative'><noscript><a href='#'><img alt=' ' src='https:&#47;&#47;public.tableau.com&#47;static&#47;images&#47;Ap&#47;Approvalsvs_Recipients&#47;Sheet1&#47;1_rss.png' style='border: none' /></a></noscript><object class='tableauViz'  style='display:none;'><param name='host_url' value='https%3A%2F%2Fpublic.tableau.com%2F' /> <param name='embed_code_version' value='3' /> <param name='site_root' value='' /><param name='name' value='Approvalsvs_Recipients&#47;Sheet1' /><param name='tabs' value='no' /><param name='toolbar' value='yes' /><paramname='static_image'value='https:&#47;&#47;public.tableau.com&#47;static&#47;images&#47;Ap&#47;Approvalsvs_Recipients&#47;Sheet1&#47;1.png' /> <param name='animate_transition' value='yes' /><param name='display_static_image' value='yes' /><param name='display_spinner' value='yes' /><param name='display_overlay' value='yes' /><param name='display_count' value='yes' /><param name='filter' value='publish=yes' /></object></div> <script type='text/javascript'>var divElement = document.getElementById('viz1581300709807');var vizElement = divElement.getElementsByTagName('object')[0];   vizElement.style.width='100%';vizElement.style.height=(divElement.offsetWidth*0.75)+'px';var scriptElement = document.createElement('script');scriptElement.src = 'https://public.tableau.com/javascripts/api/viz_v1.js';                    vizElement.parentNode.insertBefore(scriptElement, vizElement);</script>

# Data

Most of the data sources I found were on the United States Census, but some are not. I will be utilizing census data as it is considered to be the most reputable regarding my topic. Immigration law scholarly articles would also be a good source to add some fun facts and extra material. For the most part, however, I will be using data directly from the US Census as well as some other publications that provide sources for their data. Since Immigration can be somewhat of a hostile topic to research, my focus will be primarily from publicly available government-based information. Below are links to all my current publicly available data sources:

# Method & Medium

I plan on utilizing Shorthand for my final project. I choose to also utilize Tableau exclusively for visualization because much of the data I will be working with involves geography and year-to-year information. And Tableau is perfect for that. I haven't started looking into shorthand but based on my understanding of the tool is that it can be perfect for summarizing big data in a way that is easy for the end user to interpret and understand.

Thus, I will be conducting research using the data from census presented above as well as from reputable sources and news outlets to try and create a story about H-1B and how that affects the economy and internationals as a whole. My story will mainly focus on the hypothesis listed at the top of the page and I will be formatting my entire project based on coming up with an answer to that hypothesis.


# Wireframes

Below are my wireframes and initial storyboard for what I used to conduct my user feedback. As you can see, the sketches represent the outline developed in Part 1 of the Final Project. I intentionally chose not to make them "perfect" in order to squeeze in as much information and feedback as possible from the people I interviewed:

## Initial Storyboard & Wireframes

![2020-02-15 19-40](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/60077122/74621238-3b9eb100-510a-11ea-90a2-416a7b9ab045.jpeg)


# User Research

My topic is about H-1B Visas, a complex type of work visa that many immigrants (mostly students), strive for to work in the United States. I interviewed 7 different, random people to provide insights onto the sketches provided above. Below are further details of my research which include the demographics of my interviewees as well as the target audience I intended for.

## Target Audience

College or Graduate students in the United States who already have some knowledge (even if only minimal) of US work visas. My initial target audience were non-U.S. citizens studying in the United States, and while that demographic has been represented in my pool of interviewees, I decided to also include U.S. citizens in an attempt to further refine my research.

## Approach to identifying

I would first begin with asking a few background information. I start by asking if they have any knowledge of H-1B Visas and, if so, how would they rate their knowledge from 1-5 (with 5 being the highest). I would then proceed with background information such as academic major, national origin, citizenship status, age, and the gender they identify with.

## Script & Findings

I managed to find 7 individuals to participate in the study. All but one are undergraduate students at Carnegie Mellon. Below is the scenario I used for all7 individuals, including all questions asked and their answers to those questions.

### Script

As stated earlier, I begin by asking a few background information. As shown below:

1. **_Do you have any knowledge whatsoever on H-1B Visas? (if yes, then I proceed.)_**

2. **_What is the race you identify with?_**

3. **_What is the gender you identify with?_**

4. **_What is yout nationality/Immigration status?_**

5. **_What is your academic major?_**

6. **_On a scale of 1-5, how would you rate your knowledge of H-1B Visas with 5 being the highest?_**


After asking about their background, I show them the initial wireframe / storyboard and ask them to take a look at it for as much time as they need (most took less than 3 minutes), and I would then ask them the below questions regarding the wireframes:

1. **_On a scale of 1-5, how easily can you understand the information provided in the wireframes/storyboards?_**

2. **_Based on your understanding of immigration law and H-1B visas, is there anything surprising from these visuals/sketches?_**

3. **_What would you add to make things better to understand?_**

4. **_What would you remove to make things better to understand?_**

5. **_What information do you think would be beneficial for companies & beneficiaries filing for H-1B Visas to know and be included in this study?_**

### Findings

Below are answers to all 7 individuals. Several changes have been implemented accordingly in the revised wireframes at the end of this page.

# Revised Wireframes & Key Findings

Below is my revised wireframe and storyboard after taking the above feedback into consideration. As you can see, I included all major comments and omitted ones that were not relevant. I inclded my kew findings of my user research, listed below.

## Key Findings

1. Split of Startups vs. Big Companies that sponsor H-1B workers

2. The disparity between U.S. Citizen compensation vs. H-1B compensation in the represented tech companies

3. The split between F-1 and non F-1 applicants for H-1B Visas

4. How long it takes, how much it costs, what the acceptance rate is in the H-1B Visa process
