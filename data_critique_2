# Assignment 4: Data Visualisation & Redesign

## Graph by PwC
For this Data Visualization assignment, I critiqued and redesigned the below graph published by PwC in 2017 regarding the projected number of female drivers in Saudi Arabia. I chose this visualization because I was interested in a topic related to Saudi Arabia. Additionally, I am interested in how much consultants take time to review their visualizations before publishing them. In this case, PwC did not do a very good job.

## A Clean, Redesigned PwC Graph
Below is my redesign of the graph by PwC. As you can see, I omitted much of the unnecessary data such as projected male drivers (because who cares about that?). I also removed the data of overall population and, instead, compared projected female drivers with the female population in 2020. I felt like this gives more context and provides a fair representation of the projected growth of Saudi female drivers against their female counterparts. At first, I thought the data could be easily deconstructed, but it turns out PwC could have included more information such as the rate of change of the population across that 4-year period. However, that information was not provided, which led me to omit much of the data points from the original graph. It took me a while to decide on which type of visualization to use for my redesign, but through trial and error I decided that a horizontal, stacked column chart works best here. 

The overall highlight of my redesign was my reinforcement of the idea "less is more". The original PwC chart included too much unnecessary information, and unflattering iconography that did not give much context and in fact led to confusion. I wanted to edit the graph without removing anything, or at least beautifying its ugly parts, but I looked at the big picture: what does the audience want to know? They simply want to know how many female drivers will there be by 2020. That's it. I removed all of PwC's mess and concluded with a simple, yet informative (not to mention interactive!) visualization.

Here is my redesign, made with Infogram:
